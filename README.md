# RULA Score Estimator with Uncertainty-Aware Human Pose Estimation

**Date:** June 3, 2025

This project aims to develop a RULA (Rapid Upper Limb Assessment) score estimator. It leverages multiple human pose estimation models and incorporates uncertainty measurements to provide more reliable ergonomic assessments.

---
## Initial Progress (June 3, 2025)

* Repository created.
* Initial testing of **YOLO-Pose v11** for human pose estimation.
* Developed a basic RULA estimator for 2D images.

---
## ðŸš§ Future Work (To-Do)

* Integrate and evaluate at least two additional human pose estimation models (e.g., **MediaPipe Pose**, **OpenPose**).
* Refine and validate the **RULA estimator** for improved accuracy.
* Implement and test robust **uncertainty measurement** techniques for pose keypoints and the final RULA score.
